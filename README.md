# Our training examples
The test repository for the NCEAS training on reproducible techniques in R. This will be used for the rest of the training course throughout the week. 

These are the **demo** files from the tutorial. 
This *markdown* file uses the same syntax as the Rmarkdown file, however, this does not include the R chunks of code. 
For example you can use the list information

* apples
* oranges
* bananas
* your GitHub photo is adorable

## New session 

Now I am including work that I have created in RStudio. I will sync later. I just followed you. The astericks on the script means that I haven't saved the file yet. When I save it, it creates a new "M" in the Git section of RStudio that means the file has been modified. 

I like your glasses. ;)
