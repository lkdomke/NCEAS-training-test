# Our training examples
The test repository for the NCEAS training on reproducible techniques in R. This will be used for the rest of the training course throughout the week. 

These are the **demo** files from the tutorial. 
This *markdown* file uses the same syntax as the Rmarkdown file, however, this does not include the R chunks of code. 
For example you can use the list information

* apples
      * green apples
      * fuji
      * pink ladies
* oranges
* bananas
